Hello world!

My name is Victor and I am aspiring to become a data analyst. I am currently teaching myself R, Python and SQL using dataquest.io. They currently have their R lessons for free and I'm strongly considering getting the subscription that allows me to utilize all their lessons to help me learn how to become a better data analyst.
I look forward to using GitHub to share my newly gained knowledge of data analysis.
